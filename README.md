timestamp
=========

Timestamp is a social network where users post ideas, images or anything. The difference is that everything has a limit. Each post starts with a 2 day limit before it gets deleted from the Database. If a post reaches a certain number of likes/upvotes, it gets more time on the server, allotting it more time to be viewed by others and hopefully, recieve more likes/upvotes.

Time stamp is still in production. Anyone who sees this project and wishes to collaborate, contact me at ngansallo@gfsnet.org

Thanks for reading! Check back soon for launch!
